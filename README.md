# Admin Dashboard Page

## What is this ?

This project is part of my **Curriculum Series**, the objective is to have a repository to prove my skills as a web developer.

Getting a little bit deeper into CSS, I start to learn more about Web Layout making use of mainly two very powerful tools, CSS FlexBox and CSS Grid.
The focus is to practice building a webpage layout using Grid and FlexBox and not so much the content of the page itself.

## Objective

- Build a webpage to practice the fallowing topics:
  - CSS FlexBox
